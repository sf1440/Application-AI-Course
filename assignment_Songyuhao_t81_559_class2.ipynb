The image is created with dimensions 640x480 as specified in the code.\n","Item 2: Yes. The code creates 50 horizontal bars (17 yellow + 17 purple + 16 green = 50) that cycle between yellow, purple, and green colors.\n","Item 3: Yes. A white circle is drawn in the center of the image with a radius of 50, which results in a width of 100 pixels.\n","Item 4: Yes. The code specifically redraws the yellow bars over the entire width of the image after drawing the circle, ensuring that yellow bars extend fully across the image, including over the circle. The other colors (purple and green) are not redrawn, so they stop for the circle.\n","Item 5: Yes. The code includes a comment with a prompt that could have generated the part of the code that drew the image. The prompt is:\n","\"Write a Python program that draws a 640x480 image, with a white circle at center, yellow,purple,green strips cross it with order yellow-purple-green. It will start from top with yellow and there are 17 yellow strips, 17 purple strips, 16 green strips.
