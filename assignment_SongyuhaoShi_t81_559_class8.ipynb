The training dataset will always contain both the input (riddle, in this case) and the expected output (answer, in this case). The testing dataset has no \"answer\" column, which is the expected output. You will use the riddle to predict the answer for the testing dataset.\n","The training dataset looks like the following:\n","\n","|riddle|answer|\n","|---|---|\n","|I am tall when I am young, and short when I am old. What am I?|candle|\n","|What has keys but can't open locks?|piano|\n","|I have branches, but no fruit, trunk or leaves. What am I?|bank|\n","|...|...|\n","\n","Notice how the file provides the answer for the training dataset.\n","\n","The testing dataset looks like the following:\n","\n","|riddle|\n","|---|\n","|What has to be broken before you can use it?|\n","|The more you have of it, the less you see.
