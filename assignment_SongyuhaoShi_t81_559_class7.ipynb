I've reviewed your code and the output scan, and I have a few suggestions to help resolve the error and improve your solution.\n","\n","1. Precision in Calculations:\n","   The main issue seems to be that the values in the 'value' column don't match the solution exactly. This could be due to rounding or formatting issues. To ensure precise calculations, let's modify the compute_value function:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   def compute_value(equation):\n","       prompt = f\"Calculate the result of the following equation and return just the number without any formatting or rounding: {equation}\"\n","       result = agent.run(prompt)\n","       # Convert the result to an integer to remove any decimal places\n","       return int(float(result.strip()))\n","   ```\n","\n","   This change ensures that the result is always an integer, matching the expected format of the solution.\n","\n","2. Using a More Precise Model:\n","   Consider using the GPT-4 model for more accurate calculations. You can change the model in your code:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0)\n","   ```\n","\n","3. Error Handling:\n","   Add error handling to catch any potential issues during calculation:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   def compute_value(equation):\n","       try:\n","           prompt = f\"Calculate the result of the following equation and return just the number without any formatting or rounding: {equation}\"\n","           result = agent.run(prompt)\n","           return int(float(result.strip()))\n","       except Exception as e:\n","           print(f\"Error calculating {equation}: {e}\")\n","           return None\n","   ```\n","\n","4. Verification Step:\n","   After calculating all values, you could add a verification step to ensure all calculations are correct:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   def verify_calculation(row):\n","       expected = eval(row['equation'])\n","       if row['value'] != expected:\n","           print(f\"Mismatch for {row['equation']}: Got {row['value']}, Expected {expected}\")\n","\n","   df_submit.apply(verify_calculation, axis=1)\n","   ```\n","\n","5.
